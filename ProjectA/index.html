                <p>Residing in the Crepusculum biome of the Twilight Forest, it seems to be absorbing elemnents from the air and dumping it back out onto the ground. It is unknown if the Crispico is aware of its pollution, but it's actions cease during human interaction.</p>

                <p>The crispico is an almost transparent-red blob with an outer layer of shiny black and white scales. The blob is very squishy.</p>

                The Crispico was discovered in a dense part of the Twilight forest by some sciencists keen on studying the landscape. The area it lives in was deemed the Crepusulum Biome, derived from the Latin word "twilight", after the purple and blue tones of the sky. 
                It seems like the Crispico is the first one ever discovered, and it is unknown if there are more of it's kind. The main body of the creature shares similarites with a blobfish while the outer "shell", while hard, is flexible and moves around to interact with 
                the environment. During the study of the creature, it was revealed that it has no internal functions but has heightened genes that let it absorb everything through it's squishy layer. The blocks it creates are physical but dissapear after some time. If they don't, 
                they start spreading to other biomes in the forest. The only way to combat it is to interact with the creature.
                From the first discovery, it seemed that the creature liked humans. However, if they make it too irritiated, the blocks it creates become toxic and can poison the surrounding area. 
                As the creature interacts with it's environment, light scatters off its outerlayer, creating a very cool color effect. Depending on how active it is, the effect is faster/slower.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> 
                - Move your mouse to interact with the creature and surroudning environment
                - Block generation stops within certain parts of the creature body
                - Block colors change from normal to "poisonous" on mouse click
                - Press Q to witness the creature interact more with its environment
                - Press W to witness the creature interact less with its environment
