                <p>The crispico is an almost transparent-red blob with an outer layer of shiny black and white scales. The blob is very squishy.</p>

                The Crispico is a creature discovered in the Crepusculum biome of the Twilight Forest. The biome is named after its blue and purple lighting, of which creates streaks when the crispico interats with it. The creature is able to absorb nutrients and other things from the environment, depositing it back out after a bit of time.
                The origins of the creature are a mystery but local myths say it is the only remaining descendant of a powerful god, left behind from a civilization that is long-gone. If it's true, no one knows how its survived for so long.
                The objects that the crispico produces are physical but seem to vanish into thin air after some time. Although they pose no hard, sometimes there will be remains left and after a while they start spreading into other parts of the Twilight Forest.
                Upon first discovery, it seemed interested in the humans there, interacting with them and letting them poke it. It tends to reach towards you if you hold out your hand and will follow it like it's playing along.
                Interesting creature note: When it is playing with humans, it stops growing blocks. However, be careful; poke it too much and it will get angry, making the blocks poisonous.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Move your mouse to interact with the creature and some parts of it's environment that is close to it. When the mouse is moved to the main body, the generating blocks will stop.
